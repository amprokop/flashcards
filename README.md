==========
Schwa is a spaced interval flashcard webapp/Chrome extension. 

It was born out of the tedious process I experienced when trying to save flashcards while studying Korean. The steps involved were something like this: Highlight the words you want to review later, copy, switch tabs, paste, find translation, copy, paste, sync cards to device...
Schwa does all that in just a few seconds!

Schwa uses the WordReference API to search for definitions, and implements a version of the SuperMemo algorithm originally created by Piotr Wozniak. Spanish, French, Italian, and Portugese translations are currently supported. Chinese, Japanese, Greek, and Korean are coming soon.




To run the webapp locally, just navigate to the root directory and execute "node app.js" from the command line.

To install the extension locally (the webapp needs to be running as well):

1. Clone the repo.

2. In Google Chrome, navigate to chrome://extensions.

3. Click "Load unpacked extension" and select the chrome_extension directory contained in the repo.
